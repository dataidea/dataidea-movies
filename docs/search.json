    "section": "",
    "text": "IMDb\n\n\nOpenAI is suspending its ChatGPT voice, Sky, after users claimed it resembled Scarlett Johansson’s voice from the 2013 film Her.\nThe company released a statement on X (formerly Twitter) today, announcing that it is “working to pause the use of Sky” to address the issue. Many users noted the voice’s similarity to Johansson’s portrayal of an AI companion in the Spike Jonze-directed movie.\nSky is one of several ChatGPT voices available to users. OpenAI provided an explanation on its website about how these voices are selected and created.\n“We support the creative community and worked closely with the voice acting industry to ensure we took the right steps to cast ChatGPT’s voices. Each actor receives compensation above top-of-market rates, and this will continue for as long as their voices are used in our products.”\nThe statement further clarified, “We believe that AI voices should not deliberately mimic a celebrity’s distinctive voice—Sky’s voice is not an imitation of Scarlett Johansson but belongs to a different professional actress using her own natural speaking voice. To protect their privacy, we cannot share the names of our voice talents.”\n\n\n\n\n\nBackground on the Allegations\nThe controversy began last week when OpenAI revealed its new GPT-4o model during a livestream event, showcasing its ability to have realistic conversations about any topic. This functionality drew comparisons to Her, where Joaquin Phoenix’s character falls in love with an AI named Samantha, voiced by Johansson.\nAdding to the speculation, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman posted the word “her” on X after the event. In a subsequent post, he likened the new voice and video mode to scenes from sci-fi movies. In a September interview with The San Francisco Standard, Altman even cited Her as his favorite sci-fi film, praising its depiction of AI-human interactions as “incredibly prophetic.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMoving Forward\nIt remains unclear how OpenAI will resolve the concerns about Sky mimicking Johansson’s voice or prevent similar issues in the future.

    "title": "Furiosa Proves That Anya Taylor-Joy is One of Our Modern Movie Stars",
    "section": "",
    "text": "IMDb\n\n\nIt took almost a decade, but Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga is finally in theaters. The long-awaited prequel to 2015’s Mad Max: Fury Road, the latest entry in director George Miller’s post-apocalyptic franchise, centers on Imperator Furiosa’s backstory and makes for a fascinating contrast with the previous film. Where Fury Road was essentially one long high-octane thrill ride, Furiosa is a far more patient wasteland odyssey, telling the story of its heroine over many years. It’s a great movie for many reasons, particularly Miller’s strong direction and the film’s deliberate pace, but most of all because of Anya Taylor-Joy’s performance in the lead role.\nOf course, we love what Charlize Theron brought to the part in Fury Road, but the recasting goes to show not just how much new life a franchise project can be injected with by allowing a new actor to take on an iconic character, but also that Taylor-Joy is one of best examples of a 21st century movie star. How so? Let’s take a look.\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilding an Imperator\nThe road to bringing the Furiosa film to the big screen was quite different from most other blockbuster prequels. In an interview with AV Club, Miller said the screenplay for Furiosa was “virtually complete” before Fury Road’s production, meaning the story of this film was known to Miller and his collaborators before the former was even released. Charlize Theron even confirmed that she read the script for Furiosa as part of her preparation for shooting Fury Road. Her deep knowledge of Furiosa’s backstory informed her performance in that film, and helps this movie feel like a perfectly natural extension of its predecessor in terms of character, theme, and world-building. Conventional wisdom would hold that Theron would reprise the role, but Miller decided to move in a different direction.\nPart of that was because he wasn’t convinced by the current state of digital de-aging technology. Speaking to Variety, he said, “I saw not only The Irishman, but Ang Lee’s Gemini Man, with Will Smith. Both of them were masterful directors, but it was never persuasive. I thought all people would be watching is Charlize looking young and knowing it’s an effect.” The long hiatus between Fury Road’s release and Furiosa’s production also made it clear to the veteran director that he wanted to find a new actor to take up the part, which he finally found in Anya Taylor-Joy after seeing her performance in an early cut of Edgar Wright’s (underrated) psychological horror film Last Night in Soho. Wright elaborated on this story on social media, saying that he connected the pair a mere two days before the COVID-19 lockdowns in March of 2020.\nGiven how well Fury Road was received by both critics and audiences, recasting such a pivotal character for her spin-off film was certainly a gamble. After all, Furiosa really is the main protagonist of Fury Road anyway, with Tom Hardy’s Max Rockatansky being more “along for the ride” as opposed to driving the action in any significant capacity. A project that further explores the characters, factions, and visual motifs established by Fury Road would necessitate Furiosa’s inclusion because of how intertwined she is with them. Yet, more so than any other creative choice he makes in the final product, Miller allowing Taylor-Joy to bring her own spin on the character is what most helps the film feel like an essential installment in the Mad Max mythos.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnya Taylor-Fury\nAt a moment when plenty of digital ink has been spilled wondering if we still have movie stars, Anya Taylor-Joy has emerged as one of the few actors to rise within the last decade or so who deserves the title. Ever since her phenomenal debut performance in Robert Eggers’ 2015 horror masterpiece The Witch, Taylor-Joy has captivated several of the industry’s top directors, such as the aforementioned Edgar Wright, M. Night Shyamalan, Denis Villeneuve, and of course, George Miller. Beyond her work with auteurs, she’s also made a distinct impression on audiences in the Netflix show The Queen’s Gambit (for which she received an Emmy nomination), the surprise hit black comedy/horror film The Menu, and even added a billion dollar grosser to her resume with her voice role as Princess Peach in The Super Mario Bros. Movie.\nThat’s a lot to achieve in such a short time, and if Furiosa is any indication, the Argentinian sensation’s career won’t be slowing down anytime soon. What makes her performance as Furiosa so enthralling besides her natural talent is how well the story takes advantage of the differences in performing style between her and Theron. Where Theron played Furiosa as raw rage barely contained, Taylor-Joy is far calmer, her anger simmering behind the glares she gives from across the room (or the wasteland). There’s a palpable sense that the terrors she sees and endures in this movie are what leave the Furiosa of Fury Road such an exhausted and enraged main hero. During much of the prequel’s events, Furiosa’s will to survive and fire to take vengeance on her tormentors is still driven just as much by the vestiges of her idealism as her darker impulses. Her one-woman war against Dementus (Chris Hemsworth) is what finally breaks her down, what forges her into the character audiences fell in love with in Fury Road.\nThat Taylor-Joy communicates all of this mostly with her eyes and physicality — since the script gives her minimal dialogue — reinforces how forward-thinking of a choice it was for Miller to recast the role. Theron is perfectly capable of conveying those emotions, but the part of Furiosa’s internal journey we see in this new film is ideally suited to Taylor-Joy’s skills. More so than most actors currently working, Taylor-Joy is at her best when we can read everything her character is thinking along the lines of her face, in the details of her eyes. That sense of patient fury, of holding in her true feelings until she simply can’t anymore, is what gives her take on Furiosa an entirely new dimension.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKill Them With Courage\nIt takes serious artistic courage to step into the shoes of a pre-established iconic character and put so much of her own spin on the material, but that’s exactly what Taylor-Joy does. It’s a stark reminder that if there’s any one thing that’s pushed her to the front of the pack in her generation of actors, it’s her insistence on making bold choices, a mindset she’s embraced as far back as the beginning of her career. In an interview with Harper’s Bazaar, she revealed that she had to choose between her role in The Witch or a Disney Channel pilot. On the reason she went with the former, Taylor-Joy said, “I just had this really good feeling about ‘The Witch’ that made me willing to forgo the Disney experience for the thing that felt unknown to me, the thing that felt sacred.”\nChoosing roles where she digs deep into dark and messy territory with her characters has been the key to her artistic success ever since. Sure, she has screen presence and charisma to burn, but she also makes a point to challenge herself by playing characters where there are no easy answers as to how you’re supposed to feel about them. We’ve seen this with Thomasin in The Witch, Beth Harmon in The Queen’s Gambit, and Sandie in Last Night in Soho, all of whom register as sympathetic but thorny in equal measure. Even some of her lesser known films, such as Thoroughbreds and the 2020 adaptation of Emma, feature her playing with the boundaries of what’s expected out of conventional protagonists (and in the case of the latter, she even willed herself into a nosebleed in-character. Really.)\nIf anything, Furiosa is simply one more entry in a long line of confirmations that whatever else is going on in Hollywood, Anya Taylor-Joy is certain to be a big part of its future. She’s the kind of brave and idiosyncratic performer we only see a few times in a generation, and so many brand name directors falling over each other to get her in their films should be more than enough evidence that she has the proverbial “it” factor. As a film, Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga is a stunning piece, but it wouldn’t get quite that far without an actor like Taylor-Joy in the lead role to help it over the finish line. She was trusted to take a character audiences knew and loved and make her her own, and given how well she knocks it out of the park, it’s practically guaranteed that even more high profile filmmakers will trust her with their projects going forward.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "X-Men ’97: Season 1 Ending Explained and What’s Next for Season 2\n\nThe Main Villain of Season 2 May Have Just Been Revealed\n\nWarning: This article contains full spoilers for X-Men ’97: Season 1, Episode 10! Be sure to check out IGN’s review of the Season 1 finale if you haven’t already.\nX-Men ’97 has concluded its first season on Disney+, bringing significant changes in the wake of the final battle with Bastion. Although Operation: Zero Tolerance has been thwarted and the world saved from annihilation, the X-Men are now missing and presumed dead. As the world recovers, new conflicts are emerging across time.\n\nThe X-Men Save the World (Again)\nThe finale’s climax paints a dire picture for humanity. Despite Professor Xavier hijacking Magneto’s mind to undo the EMP attack, humanity still faces extinction as Bastion transforms Asteroid M into a deadly projectile. Bastion’s plan is reminiscent of Ultron’s in Avengers: Age of Ultron.\nBastion is ultimately destroyed after rejecting Cyclops’ act of compassion and being sucked into a black hole created by Asteroid M’s damaged core. Magneto, regaining consciousness just in time, prevents Asteroid M from crashing into Earth. However, the X-Men and Magneto are presumed dead after the asteroid explodes.\nThis heroic act sets a new tone for human/mutant relations in Season 2. Despite Bastion discrediting the X-Men and revealing the truth about Xavier’s death, the X-Men and Magneto’s sacrifice have shown world leaders their willingness to protect humanity. Anti-mutant hysteria persists, but the X-Men’s heroism is a powerful counter-narrative.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Marvel Cameos in Episode 10\nEpisode 10 features numerous superhero cameos, including:\n\nCaptain America\nIron Man\nBlack Panther (T’Chaka)\nDaredevil\nCloak and Dagger\nDoctor Strange\nSilver Samurai\nOmega Red\nDawnstar\nPeter Parker\nMary Jane Watson\n\nFormer showrunner Beau DeMayo suggested that many heroes are off-world, dealing with a crisis involving the Shi’ar and Kree empires.\n\n\nSaved by Time Travel\nThe final scenes reveal that Magneto and the X-Men didn’t perish; they were transported across time. Most of them landed in ancient Egypt 5000 years ago, while Cyclops and Jean Grey found themselves 2000 years in the future.\nThis time travel may have been accidental, triggered by Bastion absorbing Cable’s time-traveling techno-organic arm. With Bastion’s destruction, time holes may have opened, pulling the X-Men into different eras.\nCable, now stranded in the present, could lead to the formation of X-Force, filling the void left by the X-Men.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeeting Apocalypse in Ancient Egypt\nMagneto, Rogue, Nightcrawler, Beast, and Xavier find themselves in Egypt in 3000 BC, where they encounter En Sabah Nur, the young Apocalypse. This ancient mutant, often depicted as one of the first mutants, has a futuristic temple in the background, hinting at his battle with the time-traveler Pharaoh Rama-Tut.\nRama-Tut, an alias of Kang the Conqueror, might play a significant role in Season 2. The conflict between Apocalypse and Rama-Tut, with the X-Men’s involvement, could alter En Sabah Nur’s destiny, potentially preventing him from becoming a villain.\n\n\nCyclops, Jean Grey, and Clan Askani\nCyclops and Jean Grey arrive in 3060 AD, encountering Clan Askani led by Mother Askani. They meet a younger Nathan Summers, their son, allowing them to regain lost time. This plot mirrors the 1994 comic series The Adventures of Cyclops and Phoenix, where Scott and Jean were psychically transported to the future to raise Nathan.\nClan Askani opposes Apocalypse’s rule, indicating a connected storyline across time with Apocalypse as the central villain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Fate of Wolverine and the Other X-Men\nWolverine, Storm, and Morph are missing, leaving their whereabouts unknown. Given their popularity, it’s unlikely they died on Asteroid M. They may have been displaced in time as well.\nWolverine, injured with adamantium ripped from his bones, might have to recover physically and psychologically. His healing factor might be compromised, and he may discover his bone claws. Wolverine could face villains like Lady Deathstrike and Cyber while navigating his new reality.\n\n\nX-Men ’97’s Post-Credits Scene Explained\nThe post-credits scene shows Apocalypse on Genosha, mourning mutant losses and holding a Gambit card, suggesting Gambit might be resurrected as his Horseman of Death. Apocalypse’s presence across past, future, and present hints at a central role in Season 2.\nSeason 2 is expected to delve into the connections across time and Apocalypse’s influence, likely returning in 2025.\nFor more on X-Men ’97, explore why the series takes a minimalist approach with Wolverine and stay updated on every Marvel movie and series in development."
